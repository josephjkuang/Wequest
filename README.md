# Wequest
A new website that offers a convenient and efficient way to manage payments and requests among friends - without the hassle of manual tracking or awkward conversations about debts. With our website, you can connect your Venmo account and use cutting-edge features like reading receipts, rerouting debts, and facial recognition to make managing payments and requests with friends a breeze.

By connecting your Venmo account, you'll be able to quickly see who owes you money and who you owe, without having to dig through old messages or keep a manual spreadsheet. Our receipt-reading feature makes it easy to see who paid for what and when, while our debt-rerouting feature lets you direct funds from one friend to another, simplifying group payments.

And with our facial recognition feature, you can easily identify your friends and request payments or split bills with just a few taps. No more awkward conversations or chasing down friends for payment - our website makes managing payments with friends quick, easy, and stress-free.
